# Fizzbuzz Challenge  
## Built with  
**Programming language:** Ruby  
**Testing:** [RSpec](https://rspec.info/)

## About this repository  
The fizzbuzz kata is commonly used in technical interviews. The challenge is to write a program that takes a set of pre-defined conditions into account.  
The conditions are as follows:  
* If the number is divisible by 3, return 'fizz'.  
* If the number is divisible by 5, return 'buzz'.  
* If the number is divisible by 15, return 'fizzbuzz.  
* If the number fullfills none of the above conditions, return the number.   

### Running the tests  
 RSpec is a testing framework used for unit- and acceptance tests. In this repository RSpec is used for unit tests following both happy and sad paths.

 The tests for the _fizzbuzz kata_ are found inside of the **spec** folder. To run the tests,  execute the following command.

 >$ rspec

 The implementation file is found in the **lib** folder.
