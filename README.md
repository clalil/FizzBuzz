# Fizzbuzz Challenge  
## About this repository  
The fizzbuzz kata is commonly used in technical interviews. The challenge is to write a program that takes a set of pre-defined conditions into account.  
The conditions are as follows:  
* If the number is divisible by 3, return 'fizz'.  
* If the number is divisible by 5, return 'buzz'.  
* If the number is divisible by 15, return 'fizzbuzz.  
* If the number fullfills none of the above conditions, return the number.  

## Built with  
* Ruby  
* Using RSpec for the unit tests, following both the happy and sad path. RSpec is a testing framework used for unit- and acceptance tests.
